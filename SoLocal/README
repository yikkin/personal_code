This notebook has been written as an answer regarding the Data Science challenge
given by the company SoLocal

This challenge is divided into 3 parts : 

First : Software development in python

The aim of this part is  to create object-oriented code in order to simplify the analysis
of the json file and the excel file provide for the challenge

the virtual scenario of this projetct is the following: 

You work in a team that provides online advertising for a range of clients. 
Recently, the team has begun to collect rich data on each display advert 
shown to a customer, and whether that advert was clicked on by the customer.

two notebooks has been written for this purpose:
-classes_definitions
this is a notebook containing classes and functions to simplify the interaction / a better 
exploitation of the json file

campaign_impression.json

the data in this file has the following structure:

- uuid : unique identifier for the user who saw the ad impression
- ts : timestamp at which the ad impression was shown to the user
- conv : whether the impression led to an in-store conversion
- resp.oi : unique identifier for the client for whom the advertising campaign was run
- resp.cr : unique identifier for the content of the advert shown to the user
- resp.c : unique identifier for the advertising campaign of the impression shown to the user
- dev.os : unique identifier for the operating system of the userâ€™s device
- dev.sid : unique identifier for the source of the data
- dev.app : unique identifier of the app on which the user saw the ad impression

-load_preprocessing
this is a notebook containing "standard" functions that could be used by anyone in order 
to bring new developments to the project 

it also contain functions for a better manipulation of the excel file 

user_segment.xls

- USER_ID : unique identifier for a user (equivalent to the uuid field in the log of ad impressions)
- ANIMAL : whether the user has been identified as having a pet
- CAR_OWNER : whether the user has been identified as owning a car
- GARDEN : whether the user has been identified as owning a garden
- OFFICE_WORKER: whether the user has been identified as working in an office
- PARENT : whether the user has been identified as a parent


Second : Machine learning 

The aim of this part is to define what the best machine learning model that could eventually
be used to solve the task at hand regarding the hypothesis

Third : Review

The  idea of this part is going to be to reflect on the all work that has been done , 
and eventually open up others line of approach by answering a certain set of question
